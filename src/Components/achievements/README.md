# Achievements

- This is the react component made in order to render all my achievements.
- All my achievements are taken from [achievements.json](achievements.json), and looped over in order to display them in the achievements webpage.
- But all the styles and code in order to render each and every achievement is taken from the [achievementsComponent](../achievementsComponent/achievementsComponent.js)
