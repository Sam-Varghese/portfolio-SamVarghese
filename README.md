# Portfolio, Sam Varghese

![My Profile image](public/img.png)

Hey folks this is the repository containing the source code of my portfolio (<a href="https:/sam-varghese.com">sam-varghese.com</a>). Here are the technologies used in order to develop this portfolio:

- [React JS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)
- [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

This repository is connected with [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/). So every time I push a code, continuous deployment takes place, and https://sam-varghese.com automatically gets updated with the pushed code.
